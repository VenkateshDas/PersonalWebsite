        <h1 align = "center" >Germany & Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Coming to Germany was one of the boldest decisions I took in my life despite the challenges in myself
             and family. As the saying goes "High Risk High Rewards", this decision is also the same. </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Discovered a world where I hold the key for all my actions and consequences. Using this
                    key, I found Independence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Realised my ability to hold relationships in life which is lower than my ability to forget things
                    in life. We are most of the times a passing cloud in the lives of people we encounter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Found my patience level to be very low for bull shits which is also a causation for my limited ability
                    in holding relationships with humans.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Time and effort are the essence for any substantial and tangible accomplishments in our life. Accompanied
                    with determination and right state of mind(attitude) towards the work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Realised my motivation for running behind teaching computers and learning to improve the efficiency
                    of learning machines. Intelligent Virtual Assistants is one of the most prominent topics in my list of interested
                    topics since 2011.
                </li>
                <li>Learning to unlearn the things in life is a very important process to start a new chapter in life.</li>
                <li>I became more emotional after coming to Germany i.e more sensitive to personal matters</li>
                <li>
                    The habit of tracking monetary expenses and being more conscious on monetary subjects.
                </li>
                <li>The need for protocols and discipline in carrying out any work.</li>
                <li>Procastination is a very bad friend but the one who is with you forever. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚</li>
                <li>"Being fit" - is a phrase which is often used/thought but seldome realized.</li>
                <li>Learning to appreciate the beauty within and around me was one of the cutest realisations after
                    coming to Germany.
                </li>
            </ol>
